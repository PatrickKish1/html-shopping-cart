# Shopping Cart App

Welcome to the Shopping Cart App project! This application was built as a fun and educational journey into the world of web development, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here, we share the exciting process of creating a dynamic and interactive shopping cart from scratch.

## Project Overview

The Shopping Cart App is a simple yet functional web application that allows users to browse a list of items and add them to their shopping cart. The app calculates the subtotal, tax, and total cost of the items in the cart, and includes options to clear the cart or proceed to checkout.

### Key Features

- **Item Listing**: Displays a variety of products with images, names, and prices.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add items to the cart with a single click.
- **Cart Management**: Users can view items in their cart, adjust quantities, and see the updated total cost in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The backbone of the app, providing the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styled with custom CSS and Bootstrap to create a clean and modern interface.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the app, handling the dynamic addition of items to the cart, quantity adjustments, and cost calculations.

## Learning Journey

Creating this Shopping Cart App was a fantastic learning experience. Here are some highlights from the journey:

1. **Designing the Layout**: Using HTML and CSS, we structured the app and styled it to be visually appealing. We employed Bootstrap for responsive design and additional styling features.

2. **Dynamic Content with JavaScript**: JavaScript was used to dynamically generate the list of items and handle user interactions such as adding items to the cart and updating quantities.

3. **Handling User Interactions**: We wrote functions to manage the cart, including adding items, updating quantities, and clearing the cart. This involved manipulating the DOM and updating the displayed information in real-time.

4. **Calculations**: Implementing the logic to calculate the subtotal, tax, and total cost of the items in the cart was both challenging and rewarding.
